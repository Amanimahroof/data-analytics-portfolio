# Delhi Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis (2020–2024) using POWER BI

## Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) data from 2020 to 2024 to understand pollution severity, seasonal patterns, and the impact of PM2.5 on overall air quality. The dashboard provides interactive visual insights for environmental and public health analysis.

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- CSV Dataset
- Data Visualization & Dashboarding

## Key Metrics
- **Average AQI:** 135.16  
- **Maximum AQI:** 500  
- **Average PM2.5:** 55.66 µg/m³  

These values indicate consistently **unhealthy air quality levels**, with PM2.5 concentrations significantly exceeding WHO recommended limits.

## Dashboard Visuals & Insights

### 1. Average AQI (Card)
**Insight:**  
The average AQI of 135.16 indicates **Unhealthy air quality**, suggesting prolonged exposure risks for residents.

### 2. Maximum AQI (Card)
**Insight:**  
The maximum recorded AQI of 500 reflects **hazardous pollution levels**, where air quality becomes extremely dangerous.

### 3. Average PM2.5 (Card)
**Insight:**  
The average PM2.5 level of 55.66 µg/m³ is **well above safe limits**, confirming fine particulate matter as a major contributor to air pollution.

### 4. Average AQI by Month-Year (Line Chart)
**Insight:**  
AQI shows a **slight declining trend over time**, indicating minor improvement, though levels remain unhealthy.

### 5. Average AQI by AQI Category (Donut Chart)
**Insight:**  
Most observations fall under **Unhealthy** and **Very Unhealthy** categories, showing frequent exposure to unsafe air conditions.

### 6. Average AQI by Month (Bar Chart)
**Insight:**  
AQI peaks during **winter months (Nov–Jan)** and drops during **monsoon months (Jun–Aug)**, reflecting seasonal pollution patterns influenced by stubble burning, temperature inversion, and rainfall.

### 7. Average AQI vs Average PM2.5 (Combo Chart)
**Insight:**  
AQI and PM2.5 follow **parallel trends**, confirming that PM2.5 is the primary driver of poor air quality in Delhi.

## Summary Insight
The analysis reveals **persistently high pollution levels in Delhi**, dominated by PM2.5 emissions. Seasonal spikes during winter pose significant public health concerns, while monsoon periods bring temporary relief. Despite slight improvements over time, air quality remains largely in the **Unhealthy** range.
