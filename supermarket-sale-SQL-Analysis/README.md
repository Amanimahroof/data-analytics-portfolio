# Supermarket Sales Analysis using SQL

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of SQL for database design, data insertion, and analytical querying using a supermarket sales dataset. The objective is to structure raw data into relational tables and extract meaningful business insights through SQL queries.

## Tools & Technologies
- MySQL
- SQL
- Jupyter Notebook
- CSV Dataset

## Database Design
The database was designed using a relational approach with the following tables:
- Customers
- Branches
- Products
- Transactions

Primary and foreign key relationships were implemented to maintain data integrity.

## Tasks Performed
- Created a supermarket database
- Designed normalized tables with appropriate constraints
- Inserted data into tables from the dataset
- Performed SQL queries to analyze:
  - Customer distribution by gender
  - Branch-wise transaction count and revenue
  - Product-wise sales performance
  - Payment method analysis
  - Repeat customer behavior
  - Hourly sales trends

## Purpose
This project is part of my Data Analytics portfolio and highlights my ability to design databases, write efficient SQL queries, and perform data-driven analysis.
